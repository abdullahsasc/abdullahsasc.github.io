Let's talk about what I like what I don't forget the boring thing
I Love Pizza 🍕 As a Programmer/Self Employed I have to always stay motivated plus update own skill this is a pain in the Ass 🤫
We all know Elon Musk, I love this person because I love rocket science 🚀 but I don't know anything about Rocket science. The only thing I know about rocket is Recent Crew Dragon uses Javascript to control the Dragon and most of the think done my C and C++ that's al I know 🪐
